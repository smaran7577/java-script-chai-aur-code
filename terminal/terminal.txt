Paths: Absolute & Relative
A path is the address of a file or folder in your system. It tells the system where to find something.

-> Absolute Path
An absolute path is the full path from the root of the file system. It always starts with a drive letter like C:\.
eg. cd C:\Users\systemName\Desktop\TestFolder

-> Relative Path
A relative path is based on your current working directory (you can check it with cd).
eg. If already in => C:\Users\aipri\OneDrive\Desktop
    then just do => cd TestFolder

Making directory
-> Single directory
mkdir folderName

-> Multiple directory
mkdir outsideFolderName/insideFolderName

Deleting files:
del filename : deletes permanently instead of sending it to recycle bin 
del *.txt -> deletes all .txt files
del *.* -> deletes all files in the folder

Deleting folders:
rmdir folderName : to delete empty folder
rmdir /s folderName : to delete folder with contents; will receive a Y/N prompt
rmdir /s /q folderName : to skip the cofirmation 

Flags: are characters that we pass with commands to modify their behaviour
Flags are extra parameters added to a command to modify its behavior.
They usually start with / in Windows CMD, or - or -- in Unix/Linux.

Eg. of flags in windows CMD
1. del /f /q filename
/f -> force delete read-only files
/q -> quiet mode (no confirmation)

2. rmdir /s /q folderName
/s -> delete the folder and its contents
/q -> quiet mode (no confirmation)

3. xcopy /s /e source destination 
/s -> Copies non-empty directories
/e -> Copies all directories (Even empty ones)

4. dir /b /s
/b -> bare format (just filename)
/s -> Recursive (lists all files in all subdirectories)
